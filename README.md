## Title: タイトル
会議名や発表年も記録しておくといいと思います．It is also a good idea to record the name of the conference and the year of presentation.
Author: 著者，所属
よく見る名前がないかも軽くチェックしましょう．第1著者だけでなく，後ろの方に書かれている人物(指導教官などであることが多い)の名前もチェックしましょう．Check briefly whether a paper has names you frequently see. Check not only the name of the first author, but also the name of the person later in the list (as that person can be an advisor of the first author).
多くの人が思うより，人の名前はとても重要です．議論するときに，よく「○○さんの研究で～」という言い方をするからです．そのときにピンと来ることができるように，しっかり名前も覚えましょう．People’s names are more important than you may think. This is because when discussing a topic, we often say, “In XX’s research, they do … “. Be sure to memorize their names so that you will be able to recognize them when they come up!
